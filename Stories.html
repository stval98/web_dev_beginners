<h3>
   The Body Under the Bed
  </h3>

  <section id="The Body Under the Bed">
  <p>
    Much like ghost stories, urban legends (or myths) are horrific and tantalizing tales that are passed from person to person. They are often simple fabrication yet, sometimes, a truthful origin story can be unearthed.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    One of the most commonly told urban legends, along with alligators in the sewers and doppelgangers being a premonition of impending death, concerns a couple who check into a room, only to discover a pungent stench emanating from somewhere they can’t identify. Even after searching extensively, they find it impossible to locate the source of the nauseating odor, and so make a complaint to the reception. It takes some time, and persistence, to get the hotel to assist them but, when they do, a further inspection uncovers a body in the advanced stages of decomposition, which has been stashed under the couple’s bed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This commonly regaled story doesn’t just have one source, but several. Storing bodies inside a box spring mattress, or under a divan bed isn’t as uncommon as one might imagine. In the Capri Motel, Kansas City in 2003, a guest complained about a foul smell in his bed for days before he couldn’t take it anymore and checked out. Only then did the cleaners find a rotting body underneath the mattress. The same thing happened in the Burgundy Motor Inn, Atlantic City in 1999 when a German couple spent the night sleeping on the festering corpse of a 64-year-old man named Saul Hernandez. With almost a dozen further cases, going as far back as the early ’80s, it’s easy to see why this story became one of the most common urban legends of the pre-internet era.

  The Licked Hand

  <section id="The Licked Hand">
  <p>
    A little girl's parents were going on a business trip, and to keep her company, they bought her a dog. Every night since the day she got the dog when she couldn't sleep, she'd put her hand under the bed and the dog would lick it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A few nights before her parents were supposed to return, the girl was woken up by a dripping noise. She thought it was the sink in the kitchen. She put her hand under the bed and the dog licked her hand. She got up, half asleep, and trudged to the kitchen and turned the kitchen sink off. She went back to bed and she put her hand under the bed again and the dog licked it. She settled into bed and fell asleep.
  </p>
  
  <p>
      She was woken up again by the dripping. She thought it was the bathroom sink and put her hand under the bed and the dog licked it. She got up, still half asleep and went to the bathroom and turned the sink off. She went back to bed and stuck her hand under the bed and the dog once again licked it. The girl fell asleep and stayed asleep this time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That morning, the girl woke up and put her hand under the bed. The dog didn't lick it, and the dripping was still there. She checked under the bed and she couldn't find the dog. She noticed that the dripping was coming from the closet. The girl opened the door and screamed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The dog was hung by its hind legs by a rope to the closet. Its stomach was cut open, and blood dripped from its body. The girl turned around and found a message written in her wall in blood. It read, "Humans can lick, too!"

During the time of the Neolithic Age, which lasted from around 9,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE. During these times the world was extraordinarily different from preset time, In the Neolithic Age, there were ancient civilizations which at the time were just settling into permanent Homesteads of Rock, Which represent the oldest known structures made by humans. These ancient civilizations were also known as Nomads left behind various monuments that were carved with their beings and experiences. 
</p>

<p>
During the time between 3,500 to 2,500 BCE, the Megalithic Temples of Malta are one of the oldest structures in the world. The group consists of Old Temples Older than the Most Ancient constructions. Evidence speculates that the people who made These Ancient Monuments were Local Farmers. Their many different Temples scattered around.
</p>

<p>
The Knap of Howar is located on the Scottish island of Papa Westray and is home to a Neolithic farmstead dating back to 3,500 BCE. Made up of two adjacent, rounded rectangular, thick-walled buildings with very low doorways, This farmstead is believed to be the oldest preserved stone house in northern Europe. Many things have been discovered in these buildings such as grinders and borers which have been uncovered in other related sites. Religious  practices were also practiced in these ancient buildings.

 There were many Presidents in the time of the U.S. up to this day but there were some Presidents that were not always liked by people. For instance, Benjamin Harrison could be seen as a good President do to his deeds, for instance, Harrison contributed plenty of positives to the country, including the development of national forest reserves. But his economic policies and what historians consider to be an inappropriate allegiance to Republican leadership e=which made him a disliked President.
</p>

<p>
Another President that was seen as not up to expectations of a President that may have been heard of is Andrew Jackson he may not have been seen as a good President because he resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well-being of the newly emancipated African-Americans. He was also seen as a “worst” President because of his stubbornness of giving African Americans secured Rights
