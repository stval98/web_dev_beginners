<h3>
  First Story:The Body under the Bed
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Much like ghost stories, urban legends (or myths) are horrific and tantalising tales which are passed from person to person. They are often simple fabrication yet, sometimes, a truthful origin story can be unearthed.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most commonly told urban legends, along with alligators in the sewers and doppelgangers being a premonition of impending death, concerns a couple who check into a room, only to discover a pungent stench emanating from somewhere they can’t identify. Even after searching extensively, they find it impossible to locate the source of the nauseating odour, and so make a complaint to reception. It takes some time, and persistence, to get the hotel to assist them but, when they do, a further inspection uncovers a body in the advanced stages of decomposition, which has been stashed under the couple’s bed.

    This commonly regaled story doesn’t just have one source, but several. Apparently, storing bodies inside a box spring mattress, or under a divan bed isn’t as uncommon as one might imagine. In the Capri Motel, Kansas City in 2003, a guest complained about a foul smell in his bed for days before he couldn’t take it anymore and checked out. Only then did the cleaners find a rotting body underneath the mattress. The same thing happened in the Burgundy Motor Inn, Atlantic City in 1999, when a German couple spent the night sleeping on the festering corpse of a 64-year-old man named Saul Hernandez. With almost a dozen further cases, going as far back as the early ’80s, it’s easy to see why this story became one of the most common urban legends of the pre-internet era.
