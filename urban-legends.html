            <h2 class="card-title">The Body Under The Bed</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Much like ghost stories, urban legends (or myths) are horrific and tantalizing tales that are passed from person to person. They are often simple fabrication yet, sometimes, a truthful origin story can be unearthed.</p>
			<p class="card-text">One of the most commonly told urban legends, along with alligators in the sewers and doppelgangers being a premonition of impending death, concerns a couple who check into a room, only to discover a pungent stench emanating from somewhere they can’t identify. Even after searching extensively, they find it impossible to locate the source of the nauseating odor, and so make a complaint to the reception. It takes some time, and persistence, to get the hotel to assist them but, when they do, a further inspection uncovers a body in the advanced stages of decomposition, which has been stashed under the couple’s bed.</p>
            <p class="card-text">This commonly regaled story doesn’t just have one source, but several. Storing bodies inside a box spring mattress, or under a divan bed isn’t as uncommon as one might imagine. In the Capri Motel, Kansas City in 2003, a guest complained about a foul smell in his bed for days before he couldn’t take it anymore and checked out. Only then did the cleaners find a rotting body underneath the mattress. The same thing happened in the Burgundy Motor Inn, Atlantic City in 1999 when a German couple spent the night sleeping on the festering corpse of a 64-year-old man named Saul Hernandez. With almost a dozen further cases, going as far back as the early ’80s, it’s easy to see why this story became one of the most common urban legends of the pre-internet era.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">The Licked Hand</h2>
            <p class="card-text">A little girl's parents were going on a business trip, and to keep her company, they bought her a dog. Every night since the day she got the dog when she couldn't sleep, she'd put her hand under the bed and the dog would lick it.</p>
			<p class="card-text">A few nights before her parents were supposed to return, the girl was woken up by a dripping noise. She thought it was the sink in the kitchen. She put her hand under the bed and the dog licked her hand. She got up, half asleep, and trudged to the kitchen and turned the kitchen sink off. She went back to bed and she put her hand under the bed again and the dog licked it. She settled into bed and fell asleep.</p>                   
            <p class="card-text">She was woken up again by the dripping. She thought it was the bathroom sink and put her hand under the bed and the dog licked it. She got up, still half asleep and went to the bathroom and turned the sink off. She went back to bed and stuck her hand under the bed and the dog once again licked it. The girl fell asleep and stayed asleep this time.</p>
			<p class="card-text">That morning, the girl woke up and put her hand under the bed. The dog didn't lick it, and the dripping was still there. She checked under the bed and she couldn't find the dog. She noticed that the dripping was coming from the closet. The girl opened the door and screamed.</p>
			<p class="card-text">The dog was hung by its hind legs by a rope to the closet. Its stomach was cut open, and blood dripped from its body. The girl turned around and found a message written in her wall in blood. It read, "Humans can lick, too!"</p>

            <p class="card-text">Hi, I am Teddy. Once you read this you cannot get out. Finish reading this until it is done!</p>
			<p class="card-text">As I said, I am Teddy. I am 7 years old. I have no eyes and blood all over my face. I am dead. If you don't send this to at least 12 people I will come to your house at midnight and I'll hide under your bed. When you're asleep, I'll kill you.</p>
			<p class="card-text">Don't believe me?</p>
			<p class="card-text">Case 1: Patty Buckles Got this e-mail. She doesn't believe in chain letters. Well, Foolish Patty. She was sleeping when her TV started flickering on and off. Now she's not with us anymore. Ha ha patty, Ha ha! You don't want to be like Patty, do you?</p>
            <p class="card-text">Case 2: George M. Simon Hates chain mail, but he didn't want to die that night. He sent it to 4 people. Not good enough George. Now, George is in a coma, we don't know if he'll ever wake up. Ha ha George, Ha ha! Now, do you want to be like George?</p>
			<p class="card-text">Case 3: Valarie Tyler She got this letter. Another chain letter she thought. Only had 7 people to send to. Well, That night when she was having a shower she saw bloody Mary in the mirror. It was the BIGGEST fright of her life. Valarie is scarred for life.</p>
			<p class="card-text">Case 4: Derek Minse This is the final case I'll tell you about. Well, Derek was a smart person. He sent it to 12 people. Later that day, he found a $100.00 bill on the ground. He was premoted to head officer at his job and his girlfriend said yes to his purposal. Now, Katie and him are living happily ever after. The have 2 beautiful children.</p>
			<p class="card-text">Send this to at least 12 people or you'll face the consequences.
