            <p class="card-text">There were many Presidents in the time of the U.S. up to this day but there were some Presidents that were not always liked by people. For instance, Benjamin Harrison could be seen as a good President do to his deeds, for instance, Harrison contributed plenty of positives to the country, including the development of national forest reserves. But his economic policies and what historians consider to be an inappropriate allegiance to Republican leadership e=which made him a disliked President.</p>
			<p class="card-text">Another President that was seen as not up to expectations of a President that may have been heard of is Andrew Jackson he may not have been seen as a good President because he resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well-being of the newly emancipated African-Americans. He was also seen as a “worst” President because of his stubbornness of giving African Americans secured Rights</p>
